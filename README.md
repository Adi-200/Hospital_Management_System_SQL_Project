  # Hospital_Management_System_SQL_Project

  SQL project to analyze Hospital data
  
  Hospitals are the most important part of our lives, trying to provide the best medical facilities to people suffering from various type of illness, which may be due to change in climate conditions, increased work-load, emotional trauma stress etc. It is very much difficult for the hospital to maintain its day-to-day activities and records manually. That is why a database is required to keep records of all type of activities of a hospital.

  Hospitals interact with a lot of people in a day and there are various activities involved in day to day operations of hospitals, for example managing doctor schedules,managing patient diagnoses, managing medical histories of patients, etc. The aim of this project is to show how data related to these tasks can be made easier to manage using databases.

  By storing information in a relational database, all the tasks relate to daily functioning of the hospital can be performed easily and much more efficiently. Hospital Database Management System (DBMS) is a comprehensive SQL project designed to streamline and optimize the management of hospital operations. This project aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly solution for storing, retrieving, and manipulating various types of healthcare-related data.
